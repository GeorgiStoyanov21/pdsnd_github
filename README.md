### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
This project analyses Bikeshare data from 3 different US cities.

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.

Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
